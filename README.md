🔍 Project Overview
A machine learning-based solution to predict real estate prices using linear regression. The model helps estimate property values based on key features, assisting buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions.

❗ Problem Statement
The real estate market suffers from:

Unpredictable Pricing: No standardized price estimation.

Lack of Data-Driven Decisions: Buyers and sellers rely on guesswork.

Market Fluctuations: Dynamic changes affect fair pricing.

✅ Solution
A predictive model that:

Uses linear regression to estimate prices based on features like area, location, and number of rooms.

Provides accurate, data-backed predictions for real estate stakeholders.
